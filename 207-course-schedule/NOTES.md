dependency like topological sort
one course is dependent on other course
first we have to complete less dependent course then only we can complete dependent course
​
if there is some cycle/loop in graph then we cannot define dependency of vertices
. concept of topological sort cannot be applied here
​
Question breaks into:
1. Whether topological sort can be applied on the graph or not
a. for applying topo sort conditions are:
i)  directed graph : yes it's there
ii) acyclic : check for cycles.   <=  ANS
